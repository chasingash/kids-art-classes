# ARTSPACE - Project Portfolio 1 - HTML & CSS

ARTSPACE is a landing page which aims to provide information to Parents of children wanting to pursue art and crafts classes. Artspace offers just that, a space to create Art in a friendly environment to children of all ages.
Artspace provides information to its users who want to find out about the different art classes, age categories and contact information.

# Objective

For my first project, I will provide a professionally developed responsive website for users to find out about art classes for their children. The main objective is to demonstrate competency in HTML and CSS. It is my intention to create a static front end application demonstrating a clear purpose which is easy to navigate across all devices.

# User Experience (UX)
## Target Audience
  * Parents to kids of all ages looking to pursue various art classes.

## User Stories
  * As a first time vistor to the site, the user wants to navigate the site intuitively and to determine its purpose immediately.
  * The user wants to know where to locate information about upcoming classes. 
  * The user wants to be able to easily contact the owner. 
  * The user wants to be able to access the social media accounts.

## Design Prototype
I designed a prototype for ARTSPACE on paper first and then moved into Balsamiq where I created numerous wireframes to fit mobile, tablet and desktop devices which provided me with a clear visual outline of how I wanted my site to appear. Some changes were made along the development stage as I experimented with different layouts to suit the needs of the site and also from further research into UX design.

## Site Structure

The website ARTSPACE is a one-page website, with 4 navigation links and a clear call to action button centered in the middle of the hero section. The Homepage is the default loading page with a fully responsive navigation bar which has links to the subsequent sections, - About, Classes and Contact.


# Design

* ## Typography
 
The fonts I picked are Playfair Display and Poppins which I implemented into the CSS file via Google fonts.
* Primary Font - Poppins. Chosen for its fun, modern and fresh feel.
* Secondary Font - Playfair Display. Chosen for its traditional style. Well suited for sub-titling and complements the primary font.

* ## Colour Scheme
 
I went for a clean and fresh colour scheme inspired by this year's Pantone colour of the year, 17-3938 Very Peri ( Link colour to - https://www.primoprint.com/blog/pantones-color-of-the-year-2022/ ) which is in good contrast to my chosen background hero image.
As quoted on their site  "From a psychological standpoint, purple represents spirituality, wisdom, and bravery. It tends to make people feel mysterious and imaginative."

* ## Imagery

# Features

The ARTSPACE website is set up for easy navigation. It contains a navigation bar, a highlighted contact button when hovered over it flips colour and a call to action button centered in the middle, clearly stating “Find a class” which the user is there to do. The overall feel of the site is intended to be inviting while encouraging the user to explore more. I designed this site with mobile first in mind.

## Existing Features
 
* ### Navigation bar

Located at the top of the website, it allows its users to intuitively navigate the site. It is fully responsive and contains all links to all sections of the site. It is in a fixed position so that it stays visible, whether you scroll down through the page or use the convenient links nested inside the bar. In mobile view, there is a hamburger icon which also has a fixed position and working links.
 
The LOGO is clickable and links back to the homepage. I created it using fonts and css styling.

* ### Homepage section
 
 The homepage has a background image which fits the screen. The image is colourful and playful and gives a good clear direction of what the website is about. This is where the user lands on their initial visit. It is designed to be intuitive and user friendly.
 
 Overlaid on top of the image is where the main header text appears. It states clearly in large text what the site is about.
 
 Above the main header text, is more text in slightly smaller text and in uppercase with a catchy slogan to further draw in the user.
 
 Beneath the Main text is a simple yet effective call-to-action button that directs the user to “Find a class”

  The contact form allows for enquiries about its currently run art classes to be sent to the creator.

  The contact section is fully responsive and aligns above the map in mobile view. In larger screens it aligns to the left of the map.

* ## Bug Fixes

After testing the site on different screen sizes, i discovered some text was not aligned properly which on further investigation appeared to be due to margin and padding issues. 

I resolved with media queries and ajusting the margin and padding. 

Another issue i had was with the navigation links not stopping at the right section and catching the fixed navigation bar to cut some of the section of. 

![Chrome Mobile Lighthouse](assets/readme-images/bug.png)

I resolved this by wrapping the container inside a span element and giving it a unique ID. The i added a relative position to it in css which fixed the issue.
