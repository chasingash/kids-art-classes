ARTSPACE is a landing page which aims to provide information to Parents of children wanting to pursue art and crafts classes at a dedicated location. Artspace offers just that, a space to create Art in a friendly environment to children of all ages.

This site's target audience is parents of children who want to learn how to draw.
# Objective
For my first project, I will provide a professionally developed responsive website for users to find out about art classes for their children. The main objective is to demonstrate competency in HTML and CSS. It is my intention to create a static front end application demonstrating a clear purpose which is easy to navigate across all devices.

# User Experience (UX)
## Design Prototype
I designed a prototype for ARTSPACE on paper first and then moved into Balsamiq _link to official site here) where I created numerous wireframes to fit mobile, tablet and desktop devices which provided me with a clear visual outline of how I wanted my site to appear. Some changes were made along the development stage as I experimented with different layouts to suit the needs of the site and also from further research into UX design.

## Site Structure
The website ARTSPACE is a one-page website, with 4 navigation links and a clear call to action button centered in the middle of the hero section. The Homepage is the default loading page with a fully responsive navigation bar which has links to the subsequent sections, - About, Classes and Contact.

# Design
## Typography
 
The fonts I picked are Playfair Display and Poppins which I implemented into the CSS file via Google fonts.
Primary Font - Playfair Display -  chosen for its traditional style. Well suited for titling and headlines.
Secondary Font - Poppins - Chosen as the secondary font for its fun, modern and fresh feel and to balance out my primary font.
## Colour Scheme
 
I went for a playful and vibrant colour scheme inspired by this year's Pantone colour of the year, 17-3938 Very Peri ( Link colour to - https://www.primoprint.com/blog/pantones-color-of-the-year-2022/ ) which is in good contrast to my chosen background hero image.
As noted on their site “From a psychological standpoint, purple represents spirituality, wisdom, and bravery. It tends to make people feel mysterious and imaginative.”
